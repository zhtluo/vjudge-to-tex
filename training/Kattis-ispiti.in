[{'title': '', 'value': {'format': 'HTML', 'content': '\n    <p>It’s exam time in Mirko’s village. Everyone wants to pass\n    the exam with as little effort as possible, which is not easy.\n    Mirko realized that it would be best for him to find someone\n    who knows more than him and learn from them. Everyone followed\n    and now everyone is looking for someone to learn from. We can\n    model how well a student is prepared for the exam with two\n    integers, <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span> and\n    <span class="tex2jax_process">$B.$</span> The number\n    <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span> represents how well a\n    student understands the subject, while the number <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span> is proportional to the quantity of\n    their knowledge.</p>\n\n    <p>As the head of the village, Mirko decided that a student\n    will ask another student for help only if that student has both\n    numbers greater than or equal to the first student’s numbers\n    (no student will ask someone who doesn’t understand the subject\n    as well as themselves or who knows less). Additionally,\n    students will try to minimize the difference in knowledge\n    quantity (so that students don’t bother those that are way\n    better). If this choice is not unique, they will try to\n    minimize the difference in understanding.</p>\n\n    <p>Mirko’s village has recently become a very popular suburb\n    and new students keep moving in (in time for the exam). With\n    Mirko’s strict rules, they get confused about Mirko’s rules and\n    don’t know where to go). They decided to ask a programmer from\n    a neighbouring village for help.</p>\n\n    <h2>Input</h2>\n\n    <p>The first line of input contains an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$(1\n    \\le N \\le 200\\, 000)$</span>, the number of queries and\n    arrivals in the village. Each of the following <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines contains either:</p>\n\n    <ul class="itemize">\n      <li>\n        <p>"D <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span>", a student has moved in whose\n        knowledge is <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span> and\n        <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span></p>\n      </li>\n\n      <li>\n        <p>"P <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>", the\n        <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>-th student to move\n        in wants to know whom to ask for help</p>\n      </li>\n    </ul>\n\n    <p>The numbers <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span> and\n    <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span> are between 1 and\n    <span class="tex2jax_process">$2\\cdot 10^9$</span>. No two\n    students have both numbers equal.</p>\n\n    <h2>Output</h2>\n\n    <p>For each query ("P <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>"\n    line), output which student the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>-th student should ask for help.\n    The students are numbered in the order they moved into the\n    village (starting from 1). If a student cannot be helped,\n    output "NE".</p>\n\n    <h2>Sample 1</h2><body><table class="vjudge_sample">\n<thead>\n  <tr>\n    <th>Input</th>\n    <th>Output</th>\n  </tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n  <tr>\n    <td><pre>6\nD 3 1\nD 2 2\nD 1 3\nP 1\nP 2\nP 3\n</pre></td>\n    <td><pre>NE\nNE\nNE\n</pre></td>\n  </tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</body>\n\n    <h2>Sample 2</h2><body><table class="vjudge_sample">\n<thead>\n  <tr>\n    <th>Input</th>\n    <th>Output</th>\n  </tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n  <tr>\n    <td><pre>6\nD 8 8\nD 2 4\nD 5 6\nP 2\nD 6 2\nP 4\n</pre></td>\n    <td><pre>3\n1\n</pre></td>\n  </tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</body>\n\n    <h2>Sample 3</h2><body><table class="vjudge_sample">\n<thead>\n  <tr>\n    <th>Input</th>\n    <th>Output</th>\n  </tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n  <tr>\n    <td><pre>7\nD 5 2\nD 5 3\nP 1\nD 7 1\nD 8 7\nP 3\nP 2\n</pre></td>\n    <td><pre>2\n4\n4\n</pre></td>\n  </tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</body>\n  '}}]
